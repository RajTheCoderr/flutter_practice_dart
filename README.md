## ðŸ§  About This Repo
This repo is part of my **learning journey** to master Dart before moving fully into Flutter.  
Here, Iâ€™m uploading my **basic Dart code one by one** â€” starting with simple topics like:
- Variables
- Strings
- Loops
- Operators
- Functions
- Control structures  

Each file will show a small concept Iâ€™ve learned and practiced myself.

**By Time to time I'll update my Code
from beginner to advanced level.
